# weather

A PowerShell port of Jessie Frazzelle's go version (https://github.com/jessfraz/weather)

Provides weather information via the command line through PowerShell. This uses the [darksky.net](https://darksky.net) API and is a direct PowerShell port of [Jessie Frazzelle's](https://github.com/jessfraz) Go version. My brain can only hold so many programming languages in it's memory banks and, well, I'm trying to get some idea of how to do stuff in PowerShell I figured it was this or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
